# RC-Robo-Soccer-Robot-using-BTS7960-Motor-Driver
This project presents the design and implementation of a Remote-Controlled RoboSoccer Robot that operates without the use of an Arduino microcontroller or a brushed Electronic Speed Controller (ESC). Instead, it leverages a BTS7960 dual H-bridge motor driver to directly interface with an RC transmitter and receiver system (FlySky FS-i6), enabling precise wireless control of two high-torque DC geared motors. This simplified yet robust approach makes the build highly efficient, cost-effective, and well-suited for robotic soccer competitions, roborace events, or engineering exhibitions.

The system operates by directly transmitting Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signals from the RC receiver to the BTS7960 motor driver. These signals control the direction and speed of the DC motors without the need for an intermediate microcontroller. The robot’s movement—forward, backward, and turns—is achieved through the differential speed control of two independently driven wheels, each powered by a 500 RPM Johnson gear motor. The motor driver receives power from a 12V battery, which also supplies power to the motors. Optionally, a micro servo (SG90) can be included for a kicking mechanism or other movable parts, adding functionality during gameplay.

The robot is mounted on a stable chassis, usually made of acrylic or plastic, with two driving wheels and a supporting caster wheel for balance. This configuration allows for smooth maneuvering, agility, and responsive control, which are essential in a dynamic soccer match environment. The lack of complex programming or Arduino integration makes this project ideal for beginners while still offering performance comparable to advanced robotic platforms.
